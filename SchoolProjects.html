        <h2>Health Port Hackathon Project</h2>
        <p id="projDescript">
            During the hackathon ConUHacks with a team of two others we developed a website that
            allowed the user to book and organize all there appoinments with various health care 
            practioners. It would send you a text message of upcoming appoinments. We used HTML,
            CSS, NodeJS, and MongoDB to develop it.

        <!--DND Project-->
        <h2>DND Object Oriented Programming Project</h2>
        <p id="projDescript">
            In my Object Oriented class we created four assignments that built off each other.
            The first one was general logic to randomly create Dungeon and Dragon rooms, the second
            was to create an entire level by putting the rooms together, the third was to refactor
            and write Junit tests, and the fourth was to put it all toegther and create a graphical
            interface. I untilized OO concepts to create well designed classes and methods. I used
            JavaFX to create the interface.

        <!--Memory Mangement Project-->
        <h2>Memory Mangement Project</h2>
        <p id="projDescript">
            In my Data Structures class for one of the assignments I created a memory mangement
            system using bin files in C. The file system functioned similarly to the Malloc function
            however it was all handled manually. Using the file system I implemented linked-list and array
            implementations where the efficiency of different operations were measured and analysed on 
            the different data structures.

        <!--Binary Tree Project-->
        <h2>IMDB Binary Tree Project</h2>
        <p id="projDescript">
            In my Data Structures class for one of the assignments I created parser for the Internet
            Movie Database that would read in all of the data and seperate it into three seperate Binary
            Trees using C. Using the trees you could enter a movie title and it would tell you the actors and the
            characters they played in it. You could also enter an actor and it would tell you the movies
            they have been in and the character they played. Utilizing Binary Trees allowed for almost
            imediate searching in very large files.

        <!--Hash Function Project-->
        <h2>Hash Function Project</h2>
        <p id="projDescript">
            In my Data Structures class for one of the assignments I created three hash functions to minimize colisions in C.
            Using the Delware Data Set of licsenced professionals. Last name, issue data, and liscense number were the
            three keys used in the hashing.
